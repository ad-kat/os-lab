the mysteriously gleaming foot high words the wall proclaim:
"The Chamber Of Secrets has been opened.
Enemies of the heir,...Beware".

Long ago, Hogwarts was founded by the four most gifted wizards of the age: Godrick Gryffindor,Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.
The four coexisted quite harmoniously.
However, Slytherin was a little too vary about who should be allowed to attend the school.
He believed that magical learning should be kept only between the magical families,in other words, purebloods.
Unable to persuade the others, he decided to leave the castle.

Legends says that before leaving,Slytherin created the Chamber Of Secrets.
In the hopes that one day his true heir would unlock the chamber,the home of a monster, and unleash the horror that lies within the chamber.
The heir alone could control it and free the school of everyone that,in Slytherin's view, was unworthy to study magic.
